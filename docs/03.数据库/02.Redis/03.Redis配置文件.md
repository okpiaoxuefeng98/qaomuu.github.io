## Units 单位

配置大小单位，开头定义了一些基本的度量单位，只支持bytes，不支持bit，大小写不敏感。

```bash
# Redis configuration file example.
#
# Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be
# started with the file path as first argument:
#
# ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1k => 1000 bytes
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1m => 1000000 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1g => 1000000000 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.
```


## INCLUDES 包含

类似jsp中的include，多实例的情况可以把公用的配置文件提取出来

```bash
################################## INCLUDES ###################################

# Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you
# have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need
# to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
# other files, so use this wisely.
#
# Note that option "include" won't be rewritten by command "CONFIG REWRITE"
# from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed
# line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes
# at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.
#
# If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
# options, it is better to use include as the last line.
#
# include /path/to/local.conf
# include /path/to/other.conf
```


## NETWORK 网络相关配置

### bind

* 默认情况 `bind=127.0.0.1` 只能接受本机的访问请求
* 不写的情况下，无限制接受任何ip地址的访问

生产环境要写应用服务器的地址，服务器是需要远程访问的。

> 如果开启了 `protected-mode`，那么在没有设定 `bind ip` 且没有设密码的情况下，Redis只允许接受本机的响应

```bash
################################## NETWORK #####################################

# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
# for connections from all available network interfaces on the host machine.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
# Each address can be prefixed by "-", which means that redis will not fail to
# start if the address is not available. Being not available only refers to
# addresses that does not correspond to any network interfece. Addresses that
# are already in use will always fail, and unsupported protocols will always BE
# silently skipped.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1     # listens on two specific IPv4 addresses
# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1              # listens on loopback IPv4 and IPv6
# bind * -::*                     # like the default, all available interfaces
#
# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
# following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only on the
# IPv4 and IPv6 (if available) loopback interface addresses (this means Redis
# will only be able to accept client connections from the same host that it is
# running on).
#
# IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
# JUST COMMENT OUT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bind 127.0.0.1 -::1
```

### protected-mode

本机访问保护模式，设置no

```bash
# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
#
# When protected mode is on and if:
#
# 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
#    "bind" directive.
# 2) No password is configured.
#	
# The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
# IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
# sockets.
#
# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
# you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
# even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
# are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.
protected-mode no
```


### port

端口号，默认为6379

```bash
# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379 (IANA #815344).
# If port 0 is specified Redis will not listen on a TCP socket.
port 6379
```


### tcp-backlog

设置tcp的backlog，backlog其实是一个连接队列，backlog队列总和=未完成三次握手队列 + 已经完成三次握手队列。

**在高并发环境下需要一个高backlog值来避免慢客户端连接问题。**

> Linux内核会将这个值减小到 `/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn` 的值（128），所以需要确认增大 `/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn` 和 `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog` （128）两个值来达到想要的效果。

```bash
# TCP listen() backlog.
#
# In high requests-per-second environments you need a high backlog in order
# to avoid slow clients connection issues. Note that the Linux kernel
# will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so
# make sure to raise both the value of somaxconn and tcp_max_syn_backlog
# in order to get the desired effect.
tcp-backlog 511
```


### timeout

一个空闲的客户端维持多少秒会关闭，0表示关闭该功能。即**永不关闭**。

```bash
# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
timeout 0
```


### tcp-keepalive

对访问客户端的一种心跳检测，每个n秒检测一次，单位为秒。

如果设置为0，则不会进行Keepalive检测。

建议设置成60。

```bash
# TCP keepalive.
#
# If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence
# of communication. This is useful for two reasons:
#
# 1) Detect dead peers.
# 2) Force network equipment in the middle to consider the connection to be
#    alive.
#
# On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
# Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.
# On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.
#
# A reasonable value for this option is 300 seconds, which is the new
# Redis default starting with Redis 3.2.1.
tcp-keepalive 300
```


## GENERAL 通用

### daemonize

是否为后台进程，设置为 yes

守护进程，后台启动

```bash
# By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
# When Redis is supervised by upstart or systemd, this parameter has no impact.
daemonize yes
```


### pidfile

存放pid文件的位置，每个实例会产生一个不同的pid文件

```bash
# If a pid file is specified, Redis writes it where specified at startup
# and removes it at exit.
#
# When the server runs non daemonized, no pid file is created if none is
# specified in the configuration. When the server is daemonized, the pid file
# is used even if not specified, defaulting to "/var/run/redis.pid".
#
# Creating a pid file is best effort: if Redis is not able to create it
# nothing bad happens, the server will start and run normally.
#
# Note that on modern Linux systems "/run/redis.pid" is more conforming
# and should be used instead.
pidfile /var/run/redis_6379.pid
```


### loglevel

指定日志记录级别，Redis总共支持四个级别： `debug` 、 `verbose` 、 `notice` 、 `warning` ，默认为 **notice**

四个级别根据使用阶段来选择，生产环境选择 `notice` 或者 `warning`

```bash
# Specify the server verbosity level.
# This can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
loglevel notice
```


### logfile

日志文件名称

```bash
# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
logfile ""
```


### databases

设定库的数量 默认16，默认数据库为0，可以使用 `SELECT <dbid>` 命令在连接上指定数据库id

```bash
# Set the number of databases. The default database is DB 0, you can select
# a different one on a per-connection basis using SELECT <dbid> where
# dbid is a number between 0 and 'databases'-1
databases 16
```


## SECURITY 安全

### 设置密码

访问密码的查看、设置和取消

在命令中设置密码，只是临时的。重启redis服务器，密码就还原了。

永久设置，需要再配置文件中进行设置。

```bash
# IMPORTANT NOTE: starting with Redis 6 "requirepass" is just a compatibility
# layer on top of the new ACL system. The option effect will be just setting
# the password for the default user. Clients will still authenticate using
# AUTH <password> as usually, or more explicitly with AUTH default <password>
# if they follow the new protocol: both will work.
#
# The requirepass is not compatable with aclfile option and the ACL LOAD
# command, these will cause requirepass to be ignored.
#
# requirepass foobared
```


临时设置密码：

```Plain Text
127.0.0.1:6379> config get requirepass
1) "requirepass"
2) ""
127.0.0.1:6379> config set requirepass "123456"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> config get requirepass
1) "requirepass"
2) "123456"
```


## LIMITS 限制

### maxclients

设置redis同时可以与多少个客户端进行连接，默认情况下为10000个客户端。

如果达到了此限制，redis则会拒绝新的连接请求，并且向这些连接请求方发出“`max number of clients reached`”以作回应。

```bash
# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not
# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
#
# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending
# an error 'max number of clients reached'.
#
# IMPORTANT: When Redis Cluster is used, the max number of connections is also
# shared with the cluster bus: every node in the cluster will use two
# connections, one incoming and another outgoing. It is important to size the
# limit accordingly in case of very large clusters.
#
# maxclients 10000
```


### maxmemory

设置redis可以使用的内存量，一旦到达内存使用上限，redis将会试图移除内部数据，移除规则可以通过 `maxmemory-policy` 来指定。

**建议设置，否则可能内存占满，造成服务器宕机。**



如果redis无法根据移除规则来移除内存中的数据，或者设置了“不允许移除”，那么redis则会针对那些需要申请内存的指令返回错误信息，比如SET、LPUSH等。

但是对于无内存申请的指令，仍然会正常响应，比如GET等。如果redis是主redis（说明redis有从redis），那么在设置内存使用上限时，需要在系统中留出一些内存空间给同步队列缓存，只有在设置的是“不移除”的情况下，才不用考虑这个因素。

```bash
# Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.
# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
#
# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
#
# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to
# set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
#
# WARNING: If you have replicas attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the replicas are subtracted
# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
# buffer of replicas is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have replicas attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for replica
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
# maxmemory <bytes>
```


### maxmemory-policy

* `volatile-lru` ：使用LRU算法移除key，只对设置了过期时间的键；（最近最少使用）
* `allkeys-lru` ：在所有集合key中，使用LRU算法移除key
* `volatile-random` ：在过期集合中移除随机的key，只对设置了过期时间的键
* `allkeys-random` ：在所有集合key中，移除随机的key
* `volatile-ttl` ：移除那些TTL值最小的key，即那些最近要过期的key
* `noeviction` ：不进行移除，针对写操作，只是返回错误信息

```bash
# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select one from the following behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU, only keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU, only keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
# volatile-random -> Remove a random key having an expire set.
# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
#
# LRU means Least Recently Used
# LFU means Least Frequently Used
#
# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
# randomized algorithms.
#
# Note: with any of the above policies, when there are no suitable keys for
# eviction, Redis will return an error on write operations that require
# more memory. These are usually commands that create new keys, add data or
# modify existing keys. A few examples are: SET, INCR, HSET, LPUSH, SUNIONSTORE,
# SORT (due to the STORE argument), and EXEC (if the transaction includes any
# command that requires memory).
#
# The default is:
#
# maxmemory-policy noeviction
```


### maxmemory-samples

设置样本数量，LRU算法和最小TTL算法都并非是精确的算法，而是估算值，所以可以设置样本的大小，redis默认会检查这么多个key并选择其中LRU的那个。

一般设置3到7的数字，数值越小样本越不准确，但性能消耗越小。

```bash
# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
# accuracy. By default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
# used least recently, you can change the sample size using the following
# configuration directive.
#
# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.
#
# maxmemory-samples 5
```
